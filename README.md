# basicCalculatorWith_HTML_CSS-JS
This is my class assignment, I have developed a basic calculator using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript that will perform the basic activities like addition, subtraction, division &amp; multiplication. 
Cruntly, we uses eval() function to solve the expresion in JavaScript which is not recomended. So i tried to solve this issue by adding a calculate() functionn wich do manual instructions to perform the  operations.
